Hashmap is a data structure which is used to store key value pairs <key, value>
Eg : map< node, int > m;


IMPLEMENTATION 
Such that insertion, deletion & searching are done in constant time O(1)

Linked Lists can't be used bcoz it does all 3 in O(n) time compexity
BST can't be used bcoz it does all 3 in O(logn) time compexity

We use concept of Hashtable for doing all 3 in O(1) time compexity


INBUILT STUFF 
1. map -> O(logn) Complexity 
2. unordered_map -> O(1) Complexity
