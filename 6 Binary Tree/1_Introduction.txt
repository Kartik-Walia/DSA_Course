TYPES OF TREE 
1. Binary tree : Tree having atmost 2 childs per each node.
    Creation :
    class Node {
        int data;
        Node *left;
        Node *right;
    }
2. N-ary tree : Tree having multiple childs per each node.
    Creation :
    class Node {
        int data;
        list <Node*> child;
    }


TRAVERSAL TYPES 
1. Level Order Traversal 
    Traversal the tree by printing 1 level at a time.
    Solved using queue.
