A tree data structure is a hierarchical non -linear structure that is used to represent and organize data in a 
way that is easy to navigate and search. 
It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes. 


BASIC TERMS 
- Node : Each element fo tree 
- Root : Topmost node of the tree
- Children : Node below another node 
- Parent : Node above another node 
- Sibling : Nodes having same parents 
- Ancestor : All nodes bove a node 
- Descendant : All nodes below a node 
- Leaf : Node having no children 


TYPES OF TREE 
1. Binary tree : Tree having atmost 2 childs per each node.
    Creation :
    class Node {
        int data;
        Node *left;
        Node *right;
    }
2. N-ary tree : Tree having multiple childs per each node.
    Creation :
    class Node {
        int data;
        list <Node*> child;
    }


TRAVERSAL TYPES 
1. Level Order Traversal 
    Traversal the tree by printing 1 level at a time.
    Solved using queue.
2. Reverse Order Traversal (HOMEWORK)
3. Inorder Traversal 
    L N R 
    (Go to left part, Print, Go to right part)
4. PreOrder Traversal 
    N L R 
    (Print, Go to left part, Go to right part)
5. PostOrder Traversal 
    L R N
    (Go to left part, Go to right part, print)
    

HOMEWORK write codes for In, post, pre order traversal without using recurssion (with iteration)
