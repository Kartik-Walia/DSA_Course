A Queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and operations are peformed in 
First In First Out (FIFO) order.

We define a queue to be a list in which all additions to the list are made at one end, and all deletions from 
the list are made at the other end.  
The element which is first pushed into the order, the delete operation is first performed on that.

We always push new entry from rear & pop from front.

CHARACTERISTIC OF QUEUE 
- Can handle multiple data.
- We can access both ends.
- Queues are fast & flexible.
