WHAT IS BINARY SEARCH TREE ?
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a specific type of binary tree where a particular rule is followed that for each node in the tree, the values in its left subtree are always smaller, and the values in its right subtree are always greater.




INSERTION OF NODE IN BST 
If key < root->data, go to the right subtree and insert
If key < root->data, go to the left subtree and insert
Rest recursion will handle

Time Complexity : O(logn) similar to binary search
