IDEs (INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT)
An environment that helps you write, run and even debug code(in some cases) in programming language.
Eg: VS CODE, Code Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans etc.




FIRST PROGRAM IN C++
1. Our program will find int main(){} & start executing from there
2. int main() {}
    {}, these brackets show scope of main function i.e. code which belongs to/is defined within int main()
3. In C++, we use 'cout' to print something
4. This cout is already defined in a file (header file) which must be included before using cout 
    #include<file_name> is a preprocessor directive which runs before the program is compiled and includes 
    the file to be used later in source code. A file called iostream has cout defined in it.
5. Namespaces : using namespace std;
6. Using cout : 
    We use '<<' after cout to display something to standard output (your screen) within std namespace
7. endl : used to enter new line, just like Enter.
    endl is like "/n" which is a new line escape sequence character used in various other languages also.
    cout << Namaste Duniya" << endl 
8. ; used to terminate statements




DATATYPES
Different types of data to be stored in memory, eg: int, float, character, double etc.
Different datatypes use different amounts of memory.
Amount of memory used also depends on architecture of your CPU.

DATATYPE            MEANING                     SIZE(IN BYTES)
int             Integer                            2 or 4
float           Floating-point                        4
double          Double Floating-point                 8
char            Character                             1
wchar_t         Wide Character                        2
bool            Boolean                               1
void            Empty                                 0   

CHARACTER 
A 1-byte(8bits) datatype that takes 1 character. char ch = 'a';

BOOLEAN 
True/False. Takes 1 bit and 1:True, 0:False 
bool isGood = 1;
bool isBad = false;

FLOAT/DOUBLE 
Float takes 4/8 bytes 
Double takes 8 bytes 
float num1 = 1.2;
double num2 = 2.4;




VARIABLE NAMING/NOMENCLATURE 
1. Can contain alphabets, numbers & underscores.
2. Cannot start with a number.
3. Cannot be keywords like int, count, double, bool etc.
4. Case sensitive.
5. Cannot contain special symbols like %, $, !, # etc.
# Don't use variable names mutliple times.
# Check the sice of different datatypes for your system using sizeof(variable_name);




HOW IS DATA STORED IN MEMORY ?
int a=8;
In binary, 8 is 1000
int takes 4 bytes(32 bits), so stored as 00000000000000000000000000001000 (32 bits)
char c ='a'
a = 97 , in binary 97 = 1100001, stored as 01100001 (1 byte = 8 bits)
Characters are mapped to standard ASCII values 
'a'->97 to 'z'->122
'A'->65 to 'Z'->90




TYPE CASTING AND STORING VARIABLES 
Conversion of 1 datatype to another (if it's valid) is called Type Casting
