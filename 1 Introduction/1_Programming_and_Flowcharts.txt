PSEUDOCODE
A very simple & high level form of computer language that is used in program design




FLOWCHART
It is a diagramatic representation of an approach. 
This draws out all steps of your approahc in order.

COMPONENTS OF FLOWCHART 
1. Terminator : specifies start & end of program 
2. Parallelogram : for taking input or showing output
3. Rectangle : for operations & processes
4. Diamond : for decision making (y/n)
5. Circle : connectors
6. Arrows : to depict flow of control 




% (MODULO) OPERATOR 
Gives remainder after division
a%b = reminder of a/b




WHAT IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE ?
Programming langauge is a way to communicate with computer. 
It is a formal langauge which consists of sets of strings that produce variour kinds of machine output.
Eg: C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript etc.

Every language must be written following some rules, called Syntax of that Language 
A computer essentially only understands binary codes of 0s & 1s. A compiler processes the statement of a 
programming language into Machine code (binary)

Source Code -> Compiler -> Binary/Machine code -> Computer executes (.out or .exe)
Compiler does Translation/Conversion as well as It catches errors
