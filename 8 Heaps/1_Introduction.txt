WHAT IS HEAP ?
Heap is a data structure. 
Heap is a complete bindary tres (BST) that comes with a heap order property.


WHAT IS CBT (Complete Binary Tree) ?
- Every level is fully filled except the last level
- Nodes always added from the left (Nodes always leans towards the left)


WHAT IS HEAP ORDER PROPERTY ?
1. Max Heap : For each node, child has lower value than parent 
2. Min Heap : For each node, child has higher value than parent 


HEAP IMPLEMENTATION 
It's done in form of array 
We place nothing at 0 index

Basic Property :
If any node is at ith index, then 
- It's left child would be at 2*i index 
- It's right child would be at (2*i)+1 index 
- It's parent would be at i/2 index 


INSERTION IN HEAP (Max heap)
1. Insert the value at end (last index)
2. Take it to it's correct position (by comparing it with it's parent on basis of heap order property) 
Time Complexity is O(logn)

DELETION IN HEAP (Max heap)
Remember we're talking about deletion of Root node 
1. Put or Swap first node (root node) with Last node 
2. Remove last node 
3. Propagate root node to it's correct position 
    (by comparing it with it's largest child among both children on basis of heap order property)
Time Complexity is O(logn)
